# Buddhist Well-Being

*Buddhist Well-Being* is a happiness and well-being application inspired by Buddhist ethics

It's a cross platform desktop application and is in an early development/prototype stage

## Description

This software project is inspired by a buddhist sutra about "achiveing true happiness", but anyone can benefit from these principles:

* Friends of virtue
* Positive environment
* Learning
* Caring for family
* Sharing time, happiness and resources with others
* Cultivating virtue
* Gratitude
* Association with monks/nuns (Non-buddhists: Wise and peaceful people)
* Four Noble Truths (Non-buddhists: Self-compassion and compassion)
* Meditation

## Background

Having studied wellness factors (as part of an online course in positive psychology) i was not satisfied with the factors that i found so i started looking into the Buddhist tradition where i have a background, and found a text in the book "Old Path, White Clouds" by Thich Nhat Hanh
