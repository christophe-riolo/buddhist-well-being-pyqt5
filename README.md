## Description

This software project is inspired by a buddhist sutra about "achiveing true happiness", but anyone can benefit from these principles:

* Having friends of virtue
* Living in a positive environment
* Learning
* Caring for family
* Sharing time, happiness and resources with others
* Cultivating virtue
* Gratitude
* Associating with monks/nuns (Non-buddhists: Wise and peaceful people)
* Living with an awareness of the Four Noble Truths (Non-buddhists: Self-compassion and compassion)
* Meditation

What this application does is to help the user keep these ten principles ("observances") in mind by allowing the user to select them when writing diary entries/notes. Also it can be used in a more casual fashion by adding actions connected to the ten observances and then using these actions by adding them to the diary (optionally with notes)

Also planned:
* Adding a reminder system for the actions (karma)
* Visualizing for the user how many times lately she has done something connected with the observances

### Background

Having studied wellness factors (as part of an online course in positive psychology) i was not satisfied with the factors that i found so i started looking into the Buddhist tradition where i have a background, and found a text in the book "Old Path, White Clouds" (by Thich Nhat Hanh) which directed at laypeople and was very practical. This stuck with me for some time and eventually i decided to start working on this project thinking that a diary application would be a useful format for encouriging people to focus on these principles

## Installation

There is no installation packages but it's really simple to install by following these steps:

1. Download the Python 3.x installation package for your platform: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Python 3.x
3. On the command line: `pip3 install --upgrade pip` (On Ubuntu use `sudo`)
4. On the command line: `pip3 install PyQt5` (On Ubuntu use `sudo`)
5. Download the project files from GitHub, either [using this link](https://github.com/SunyataZero/buddhist-well-being-pyqt5/archive/master.zip) or by clicking on the "Clone or download" button and then "Download ZIP"
6. Unzip the downloaded file

### Advanced setup (optional)

Please note: *This is not necessary for running the application*

#### GNU/Linux systems

For desktop systems that are compatible with the [freedesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org/) standard - for example Gnome and KDE - you can use the bwb.desktop file included in the source

To use this file:

1. Edit the `bwb.desktop` file and change the paths to match the path that you are using
2. Copy the `bwb.desktop` file to your desktop or any place where you want to be able to start the application from
3. Copy the `bwb.desktop` file to `/usr/share/applications/` using `sudo` - this will make the application visible in any start-menu-like menu (in Lubuntu this is called the "main menu" and it's shown when clicking the button in the lower left, "vanilla" (the ordinary) Ubuntu may not have a menu like this


## Usage

1. Change directory to where the software files have been extracted
2. Type and run `python3 buddhist-well-being-pyqt5.py` on GNU/Linux systems or `python buddhist-well-being-pyqt5.py` on Windows (TBD: MacOS)
