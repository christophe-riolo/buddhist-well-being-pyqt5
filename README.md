# Buddhist Well-Being

*Buddhist Well-Being* is a happiness and well-being diary application inspired by Buddhist ethics

It's a cross-platform desktop application and is in an early development/prototype stage


## Description

This software project is inspired by a buddhist sutra about "achiveing true happiness", but anyone can benefit from these principles:

* Having friends of virtue
* Living in a positive environment
* Learning
* Caring for family
* Sharing time, happiness and resources with others
* Cultivating virtue
* Gratitude
* Associating with monks/nuns (Non-buddhists: Wise and peaceful people)
* Living with an awareness of the Four Noble Truths (Non-buddhists: Self-compassion and compassion)
* Meditation

What this application does is to help the user keep these ten principles ("observances") in mind by allowing the user to select them when writing diary entries/notes. Also it can be used in a more casual fashion by adding actions connected to the ten observances and then using these actions by adding them to the diary (optionally with notes)

Also planned:
* Adding a reminder system for the actions (karma)
* Visualizing for the user how many times lately she has done something connected with the observances

### Background

Having studied wellness factors (as part of an online course in positive psychology) i was not satisfied with the factors that i found so i started looking into the Buddhist tradition where i have a background, and found a text in the book "Old Path, White Clouds" (by Thich Nhat Hanh) which directed at laypeople and was very practical. This stuck with me for some time and eventually i decided to start working on this project thinking that a diary application would be a useful format for encouriging people to focus on these principles
