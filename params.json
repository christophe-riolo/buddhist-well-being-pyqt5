Also it can be used in a more casual fashion by adding actions connected to the ten observances and then using these actions by adding them to the diary (optionally with notes)\r\n\r\nAlso planned:\r\n* Adding a reminder system for the actions (karma)\r\n* Visualizing for the user how many times lately she has done something connected with the observances\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nHaving studied wellness factors (as part of an online course in positive psychology) i was not satisfied with the factors that i found so i started looking into the Buddhist tradition where i have a background, and found a text in the book \"Old Path, White Clouds\" (by Thich Nhat Hanh) which directed at laypeople and was very practical. This stuck with me for some time and eventually i decided to start working on this project thinking that a diary application would be a useful format for encouriging people to focus on these principles\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nGPLv3\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThere is no installation packages but it's really simple to install by following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download the Python 3.x installation package for your platform: https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n2. Install Python 3.x\r\n3. On the command line: `pip3 install --upgrade pip` (On Ubuntu use `sudo`)\r\n4. On the command line: `pip3 install PyQt5` (On Ubuntu use `sudo`)\r\n5. Download the project files from GitHub, either [using this link](https://github.com/SunyataZero/buddhist-well-being-pyqt5/archive/master.zip) or by clicking on the \"Clone or download\" button and then \"Download ZIP\"\r\n6. Unzip the downloaded file\r\n\r\n### Advanced setup (optional)\r\n\r\nPlease note: *This is not necessary for running the application*\r\n\r\n#### GNU/Linux systems\r\n\r\nFor desktop systems that are compatible with the [freedesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org/) standard - for example Gnome and KDE - you can use the bwb.desktop file included in the source\r\n\r\nTo use this file:\r\n\r\n1. Edit the `bwb.desktop` file and change the paths to match the path that you are using\r\n2. Copy the `bwb.desktop` file to your desktop or any place where you want to be able to start the application from\r\n3. Copy the `bwb.desktop` file to `/usr/share/applications/` using `sudo` - this will make the application visible in any start-menu-like menu (in Lubuntu this is called the \"main menu\" and it's shown when clicking the button in the lower left, \"vanilla\" (the ordinary) Ubuntu may not have a menu like this\r\n\r\n### Hardware recommendations\r\n\r\n* Works best on screens with a resolution of at least 1366x768\r\n* No network connection is needed\r\n* Does not take much processor and memory resources, expected to run smoothly on most system \r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Change directory to where the software files have been extracted\r\n2. Type and run `python3 buddhist-well-being-pyqt5.py` on GNU/Linux systems or `python buddhist-well-being-pyqt5.py` on Windows (TBD: MacOS)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nFeedback is very welcome! If you send us feedback it can help improve the software\r\n\r\n### Ideas for improving the software\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SunyataZero/buddhist-well-being-pyqt5/issues\r\n\r\n### Reporting bugs\r\n\r\nPlease use the GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/SunyataZero/buddhist-well-being-pyqt5/issues\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to file a bug! *You are helping to improve the software*. Also if something is unclear in the *documentation* that counts as a bug as well, so please report it\r\n\r\n### Positive feedback\r\n\r\nThis is good to know so that we know what to keep, also it gives motivation to continue working on the software\r\n",
